# chat
Tcp chat made in Rust with a GUI

## TODO
Create guidelines for messages and username (data that is sent in general), also guidlines for max amount of clients
Clean up all code
username colors
On a client connect the server will send its guidelines, this means the server dropping anything that does not follow these will not be as bad of a practice.
